<h3>What is the company radar?</h3>

<p>
Some companies worry about their customers, products and services while others suck. This radar displays our experience with some of the companies we interact with regularly.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li><strong>AWESOME</strong> &mdash; Awesome companies truly care about their products, their services and their customers. They are responsive, accessible, find solutions and go the extra mile to resolve any problems. An awesome company provides a delightful experience for the customer even when problems, rarely, arise.</li>
<li><strong>GOOD</strong> &mdash; Good companies will pay attention to their products and customers. They will generally make things right by the customer and resolve any issues.</li>
</ul>

</td><td>
<ul>
<li><strong>BAD</strong> &mdash; Bad companies provide bad services, products and disregard their customers as soon as they have collected the money.</li>
<li><strong>HORRIBLE</strong> &mdash; Horrible companies completely suck at what they do. They are unreliable, constantly screw up, and have a company culture of disregard for their customers. They attempt to waste as much time as possible when a problem arises and are an endless source of loopholes to get nothing resolved. Their products are very bad quality or directly broken from the get-go.</li>
</ul>
